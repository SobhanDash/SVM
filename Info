A support vector machine(SVM) works by dividing data into multiple classes using something called a hyper-plane.

A hyper plane is a fancy word for something that is straight that can divide data points.

When we create a hyper-plane we need to do as follows: We must pick two points that are known as our support vectors.
These points must be the two closest points to the hyper-plane and their distance from the hyper-plane must be identical.

We need a margin to seperate the data points. The margin is the distance that separates all of the points in our test data.
Typically the greater our margin the better our classification will be.

Kernels provide a way for us to create a hyper-plane for data like seen above. We use a kernel to bring our data up to a higher dimension.
A kernel is  basically a function that takes soem input and gives an output that increases the dimension of the inputs by 1. 
There are number of famous kernels some of them are linear, polynomial, rbf, sigmoid.

There are 2 types of margin, hard and soft margins.
Hard margin doesn't allow any data points to exist within the margin and if it does then its not considered as valid.
Soft margin takes the data point insdide the margin and makes use of it.

The amount of points you allow to exists inside the margin is something we can define as hyper-parameter.
